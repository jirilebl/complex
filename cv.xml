        <title>Complex Numbers</title>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	    Le plus court chemin entre deux vérités dans le domaine réel passe par le domaine complexe.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Between two truths of the real domain, the easiest and shortest path quite often passes through the complex domain.
	  </p>
	  <attribution>Jacques Hadamard</attribution>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	  One of the most basic problems in mathematics is solving equations.
	  Equation such as <m>x+2=3</m>, we could solve in antiquity;
	  <m>x=1</m>.  And we could do it just with integers.  A little harder one is
	  <m>2x = 3</m>, now we need fractions (rational numbers) to find the
	  solution of <m>x=\frac{3}{2}</m>, again we could do this since
	  antiquity.  In some sense cheating, we simply said
	  <q>there has to be a number we get when we divide 3 by
	    2, and so we will call it <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>.</q>  The equation
	  <m>x^2=2</m> presents another conundrum.  On one hand <m>x</m> is 
	  the length of the diagonal of a square tile of side one, so we are
	  convinced that such a number exists.  And yet it was already known to ancient
	  greeks that there is no fraction that will work.
	  Again we solve it by cheating a little.  We call this number
	  <em>the square root of 2</em> which just means <q>the number which
	  when we square we get 2</q>.
	  OK, we got out of those difficulties relatively easy.
	  The equation <m>x+1=1</m> turned out to be a bit harder
	  than you would have thought from the modern perspective,
	  as it took people quite some time to
	  treat zero as a number.  Next, an equation such as
	  <m>x+3=2</m> was a problem until about the middle ages,
	  when we decided to just bite the bullet and think of <em>negative
	    numbers</em> as <q>numbers</q>.  Nowadays you find negative
	  numbers everywhere, quantities such as temperature can be negative.
	  But at one time people didn't think of these as actual numbers.
	</p>

	<p>
	  All the numbers we saw up till now were <em>real numbers</em>.
	  The real numbers are those numbers that can be represented as points
	  on an infinite line.  We have algebraic operations of addition and
	  multiplication, and the real numbers satisfy many nice algebraic
	  properties (they are a <em>field</em> if you heard this term).
	</p>

	<p>
	  The reals are a wonderful set of numbers and we so wish
	  that we could work with them, but then
	  we try to solve the equation <m>x^2=-1</m>, and we are in
	  trouble again.  There is no real number whose square is <m>-1</m>
	  since the square of a real number is never negative.  Fear not, we
	  have gotten out of this trouble before, we will just <q>invent</q>
	  a new number.  Let us call it <m>i</m>, although some people,
	  especially engineers, will call it <m>j</m>, and some people will
	  even just always write <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> instead of <m>i</m>.
	  We will write <m>i</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  So, we simply start with the real numbers and we throw in 
	  <m>i</m> as if it were an unknown and we call the result the
	  <idx>complex numbers</idx>
	  <term>complex numbers</term>.  Then, whenever we can simplify
	  with <m>i^2=-1</m>, we do so.  For example:
	  <me>
	    {(1+3i)}^2 = 1 + 6i +9i^2 = 1 + 6i - 9 = -8 + 6i ,
	  </me>
	  or
	  <me>
	    (1+3i)(2-5i) - 9i = 2 + 6i -5 i - 15 i^2 - 9i = 2+i + 15 - 9i = 17-8i .
	  </me>
	  A little bit of thought reveals that if we think of the operations of
	  multiplications and addition, we can write all of the <em>complex
	    numbers</em> as
	  <me>
	    x+iy
	  </me>
	  where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers.  We will usually use
	  the letter <m>z</m> or <m>w</m> for complex numbers.  That is, we
	  write <m>z=x+iy</m>.  Similarly we will generally use 
	  <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> for real numbers.  If <m>z=x+iy</m>,
	  the number <m>x</m> is called the <idx>real part</idx><term>real part</term> and
	  the number <m>y</m> is called the <idx>imaginary part</idx><term>imaginary part</term>.  We use
	  the notation
	  <me>
	    \Re z = \Re (x+iy) = x, \qquad \Im z = \Im (x+iy) = y.
	  </me>
	  For example <m>\Re (3-5i) = 3</m> and
	  <m>\Im (3-5i) = -5</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The terminology real, complex, and imaginary is perhaps misleading.
	  There is nothing more imaginary about <m>i</m> then there is
	  about rational numbers, roots, zero, or negative real numbers.
	  They simply appear in different applications.  They may look a
	  little strange, a little abstract, but so did zero to the ancient greeks.
	</p>

	<p>
	  By working out the expressions we arrive at
	  <me>
	    (x+iy)+(a+ib) = (x+a) + i(y+b)
	  </me>
	  <me>
	    (x+iy)(a+ib) = (xa-yb) + i(xb+ya) .
	  </me>
	  We can also work out the <idx>additive
	    inverse</idx><idx>multiplicative inverse</idx>
	  additive and multiplicative inverses.
	  The additive, that is <m>-z</m> is really easy:
	  Notice <m>(x+iy)+(-x-iy) = 0</m>, so <m>-(x+iy) = -x-iy</m>.
	  The multiplicative is somewhat more difficult.
	  Given a nonzero <m>z</m> we wish to find <m>z^{-1}</m>
	  such that <m>zz^{-1} = 1</m>.  It turns out that 
	  if <m>x+iy \not=0</m>, that is if at least one of <m>x</m>
	  or <m>y</m> is nonzero, then
	  <me>
	    {(x+iy)}^{-1} = \frac{1}{x+iy} =
	    \frac{x-iy}{x^2+y^2} =
	    \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} - i \frac{y}{x^2+y^2}.
	  </me>
	  For example,
	  <me>
	    {(2+i3)}^{-1} = \frac{1}{2+i3} =
	    \frac{2-i3}{2^2+3^2} =
	    \frac{2}{13} - i \frac{3}{13}.
	  </me>
	  Let's test it out, using the formula for multiplication
	  <me>
	    \begin{split}
	    (2+3i) {(2+i3)}^{-1} &amp; = 
	    (2+3i) \left( \frac{2}{13} - i \frac{3}{13} \right)
	    \\
	    &amp;
	    =
	    \left( 2 \frac{2}{13} - 3 \frac{-3}{13} \right)
	    +i
	    \left( 2 \frac{3}{13} - 3 \frac{2}{13} \right)
	    =
	    1 + 0i = 1.
	    \end{split}
	  </me>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Notice that <m>x-iy</m> in the above formula.  This is an important
	  enough operation that we give it a name and notation.
	  The <idx>complex conjugate</idx><term>complex conjugate</term> or perhaps just
	  <idx>conjugate</idx><term>conjugate</term>.
	  This operation is really new for complex numbers and
	  you have not seen for real numbers.  We usually write it
	  with a bar over the number.
	  <me>
	    \bar{z} = \overline{x+iy} = x-iy .
	  </me>
	  So for example <m>\overline{9-3i} = 9+3i</m> or <m>\overline{5i} = -5i</m>.
	  That is, you simply flip the sign of the imaginary part.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Complex numbers are a <idx>field</idx><idx>field of complex
	    numbers</idx><em>field</em> just like the real numbers.
	  As the real numbers are just part of the complex numbers we still
	  have 0 and 1.  We have additive and multiplicative inverses (see
	  above).
	  And they satisfy the following properties
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <em>Associative laws: </em>
	      <m>z_1+(z_2+z_3) = (z_1+z_2)+z_3, \quad
		z_1(z_2z_3) = (z_1z_2)z_3.</m>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <em>Distributive law: </em>
	      <m>z_1(z_2+z_3) = z_1z_2+z_1z_3.</m>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <em>Commutative laws: </em>
	      <m>z_1+z_2 = z_2+z_1, \quad z_1z_2 = z_2z_1.</m>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <!--FIXME there is a new paragraph in the output here where there should be none -->
	  Similarly there are rules for the conjugation:
	  <me>
	    \overline{z_1+z_2} = \bar{z}_1+\bar{z}_2,\qquad
	    \overline{z_1z_2} = \bar{z}_1\bar{z}_2,\qquad
	    \overline{\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)} = \frac{1}{\bar{z}}.
	  </me>
	  It is easy to see that conjugation is a so called involution, that is, applying it twice gets us back to where we were:
	  <me>
	    \bar{\bar{z}} = z .
	  </me>
	  Finally, a formula which will become very useful is the following.
	  Suppose that <m>z=x+iy</m>.  Then
	  <me>
	    z\bar{z} = (x+iy)(x-iy) = x^2+y^2 .
	  </me>
	  Notice that this is the expression that appeared in the denominator
	  of the multiplicative inverse.  It is not hard to see why:
	  <me>
	    \frac{1}{x+iy} = \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\bar{z}}{z\bar{z}} =
	    \frac{x-iy}{x^2+y^2} =
	    \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} - i \frac{y}{x^2+y^2} .
	  </me>
	</p>
	<p>
	  And while it seems that we have just made real numbers better,
	  there is one thing that we did lose.  Real numbers are
	  <em>ordered</em> in a nice way, that is, given two distinct real
	  numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then either <m>x\lt y</m> or <m>y\lt
	    x</m>.  For complex numbers, there is no natural order.  That is,
	  there is no way to order the numbers in a way that would play nice
	  with the algebraic operations.  It is a general fact of math (and
	  life) that when you find a new object that does something better,
	  you will also lose something.  There is no such thing as a free
	  lunch.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It turns out that by adding <m>i</m> we have not only
	  solved the equation <m>z^2=-1</m>.  We have ensured that all
	  polynomial equations have solutions.  This is not easy to see, but it
	  is true.  In fact, any polynomial of degree <m>d</m>
	  must have exactly <m>d</m> roots, though some roots may be repeated.
	  This is perhaps the main reason why complex analysis is such a powerful
	  tool.

	    The real numbers are geometrically represented by an infinite

	<subsection xml:id="modulussubsec">
	  <title>Modulus</title>

	  <p>
	    Think of a complex number <m>z=x+iy</m> as its position
	    vector, that is, a vector from the origin to <m>z</m>.  If
	    we measure the euclidean length of this vector and we call that length the
	    <idx>modulus</idx><term>modulus</term>.  We write it as if it were the absolute value:
	    <me>
	      \abs{z} = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} .
	    </me>
	    For example <m>\abs{2-3i} = \sqrt{2^2+{(-3)}^2} = \sqrt{13}</m>.
	    If you recall the last section, we find that
	    <m>\abs{z}=\sqrt{z\bar{z}}</m> or
	    <m>\abs{z}^2=z\bar{z}</m> (in many computations dealing with a squared quantity is easier than dealing with a square root of a quantity).
	    Another thing to notice is that if <m>y=0</m>, then
	    <m>\abs{z} = \abs{x+0i} = \sqrt{x^2} = \abs{x}</m>, the standard absolute value
	    on the real numbers.  So we have not confused matters by using
	    the same notation for both.  In fact, sometimes the modulus is
	    just called the <idx>absolute value</idx><em>absolute value</em>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The modulus gives a distance between any two points, not just
	    the origin and <m>z</m>.
	    If <m>z=x+iy</m> and
	    <m>w=a+ib</m>, then the <idx>distance</idx><term>distance</term> between them (using
	    the standard euclidean distance in the plane) is
	    <me>
	      \abs{z-w} = \sqrt{{(x-a)}^2+{(y-b)}^2} .
	    </me>
	    For example, the distance between <m>1-2i</m> and <m>-3+3i</m>
	    is <m>\abs{(1-2i)-(-3+3i)} = \abs{4-5i} = \sqrt{41}</m>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The modulus satisfies a number of useful properties.  Let us list the
	    properties that are easy to verify:
	    <me>
	      \abs{z} = \abs{\bar{z}} = \abs{-z} ,
	    </me>
	    <me>
	      \abs{zw} = \abs{z}\abs{w} ,
	    </me>
	    and if <m>w \not= 0</m> then
	    <me>
	      \abs{\frac{1}{w}} = \frac{1}{\abs{w}} , \quad \text{and so} \quad
	      \abs{\frac{z}{w}} = \frac{\abs{z}}{\abs{w}} .
	    </me>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Finally it satisfies the so-called <idx>triangle inequality</idx><term>triangle inequality</term>.
	    <me>
	      \abs{z+w} \leq \abs{z}+\abs{w}
	    </me>
	    This inequality can also be generalized to several
	    variables:
	    <me>
	      \abs{z_1+z_2+\cdots+z_n} \leq
	      \abs{z_1}+\abs{z_2}+\cdots+\abs{z_n} .
	    </me>
	    Another generalization is the <idx>inverse triangle inequality</idx><term>inverse triangle inequality</term>:
	    <me>
	      \bigl\lvert \abs{z}-\abs{w} \bigr\rvert \leq \abs{z-w} .
	    </me>
	  </p>

	<subsection xml:id="argumentsubsec">
	  <title>Argument</title>

	  <p>
	    A vector is described by two quantities, a direction and a
	    magnitude.  We have the magnitude, that is the modulus.  In a two-dimensional plane
	    a direction can be described by an angle.  So let
	    the <idx>argument</idx><term>argument</term> of <m>z</m> be the angle that the vector
	    of <m>z</m> makes with the positive real axis.  We will use a
	    positive number if the angle is in the counterclockwise direction,
	    and a negative number if the angle is in the clockwise direction.
	    The modulus and the argument are simply the two numbers describing the
	    point <m>z</m> using polar coordinates.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    FIXME: draw including the examples below
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    So the argument of a positive real number is 0.  The argument of
	    <m>i</m> is <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.  The argument of
	    <m>1+i</m> is <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>.  The argument of <m>-i</m> is
	    <m>\frac{-\pi}{2}</m>.  And the argument of a negative real
	    number is <m>\pi</m> or <m>-\pi</m>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Notice that the angle is not unique.  For example <m>i</m>
	    could also have argument <m>\frac{\pi}{2}+2\pi = \frac{5
	      \pi}{2}</m>, which just means we go once more around the origin
	    in the counterclockwise direction.  Or we may have that
	    the argument is <m>\frac{-3\pi}{2}</m> if we go in the opposite
	    direction.  See figure FIXME.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    FIXME: draw figure
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    We are really just looking at polar coordinates that you
	    know and love from calculus. 
	    If <m>z=x+iy</m> is of modulus <m>r</m> and argument <m>\theta</m>,
	    then
	    <me>
	      x = r \cos \theta, \qquad
	      y = r \sin \theta.
	    </me>
	    Therefore we have the following formula for the argument
	    <me>
	      \cos \theta = \frac{x}{\abs{z}}, \qquad
	      \sin \theta = \frac{y}{\abs{z}} .
	    </me>
	    Of course <m>\theta</m> is only defined up to a multiple of
	    <m>2\pi</m> as are all angles in the plane.
	    We write the argument as

	    Since the argument is not a unique number it is sometimes conventient

	  <p>
	    If <m>z</m> has modulus <m>r</m> and argument <m>\theta</m> then we can write
	    <me>
	      z= r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta ) .
	    </me>
	    Let us give a name to the expression in the parenthesis.  Let us write
	    <me>
	      e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta .
	    </me>
	    This extends the definition of the exponential to the imaginary numbers.  To extend to all
	    complex numbers, we recall the laws of exponents and we wish our new extension to also satisfy
	    these laws.  It therefore makes sense to define for <m>z=x+iy</m>:
	    <me>
	      e^z = e^{x+iy} = e^x e^{iy} = e^x ( \cos y + i \sin y ) .
	    </me>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    FIXME: examples
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The exponential satisfies many useful properties.  Let us list some
	    that are easy to verify from the definition and from properties of
	    the real exponential, the sine, and the cosine.
	    <me>
	      e^{z+w} = e^ze^w, \qquad
	      e^{-w} = \frac{1}{e^w}, \qquad
	      e^{z-w} = \frac{e^z}{e^w},
	    </me>
	    <me>
	      \overline{e^{z}} = e^{\bar{z}} , \qquad
	      \abs{e^{x+iy}} = e^x ,
	    </me>
	    and for any integer <m>k</m>:
	    <me>
	      e^{z} = e^{z+2\pi i} = 
	      e^{z-2\pi i} = e^{z+4\pi i} = 
	      e^{z+2k\pi i} .
	    </me>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The exponential function plays a central role in this subject and
	    we will see it often.  Let us first notice that it gives a
	    convenient way of writing a complex number using the polar
	    coordinates:
	    <me>
	      z = re^{i\theta} .
	    </me>
	    And using the properties of the exponential we find that
	    multiplication is more convenient in the polar coordinates.  Let
	    <m>z = re^{i\theta}</m> and <m>w = se^{i\eta}</m>.  Then
	    <me>
	      zw = ( re^{i\theta} ) ( se^{i\eta} ) = (rs) e^{i(\theta+\eta)} .
	    </me>
	    So in polar coordinates when we multiply complex numbers we
	    multiply the moduli and we add the arguments.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    This last property gives an interpretation of the complex number
	    multiplication as dilation and rotation around the origin.  That
	    is, multiplying by <m>re^{i\theta}</m> dilates by factor of
	    <m>r</m> and rotates by angle <m>\theta</m>.  In particular, since
	    <m>i = e^{i\pi/2}</m>, and <m>\pi/2 = 90^\circ</m>, we see that
	    multiplying by <m>i</m> rotates around the origin by
	    <m>90^\circ</m>.

	  <title>Roots of Unity</title>

	  <p>
	    We have mentioned that complex numbers always provide exactly the
	    right number of roots to polynomial equations.  Let us consider the
	    equation
	    <me>
	      z^d = 1 .
	    </me>
	    Clearly <m>z=1</m> is a solution.  But we claim there are always
	    exactly <m>d</m> distinct solutions.  First let us see what happens
	    when we take a power.  Write <m>z = r e^{i \theta}</m>.  Then
	    <me>
	      z^d = r^d {(e^{i \theta})}^d = r^d e^{id\theta} .
	    </me>
	    So now suppose that
	    <me>
	      z^d = r^d e^{id\theta}  = 1 .
	    </me>
	    Two points in the plane are equal means their moduli (distance to origin)
	    are equal, so <m>r^d = 1</m>, and there is only one nonnegative real number
	    <m>r</m> solving this equation, and that is <m>r=1</m>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    It is a little bit more difficult with the argument.  The argument is only
	    determined up to adding a multiple of <m>2\pi</m>.  The argument of
	    <m>1</m> is <m>0</m> or <m>2\pi</m> or any other multiple of <m>2\pi</m>.
	    So <m>e^{id\theta}  = 1</m> if there exists some integer <m>k</m> such that
	    <me>
	      d\theta = 2k \pi, \qquad \text{or} \qquad
	      \theta = \frac{k}{d} 2 \pi .
	    </me>
	    We notice that for <m>k=0,1,2,\ldots,d-1</m> we obtain different <m>\theta</m>
	    between <m>0</m> and <m>2\pi</m>.  For any other <m>k</m> we could add and subtract
	    a multiple of <m>2\pi</m> and get into the previous situation.  Hence the
	    <m>\theta</m> are
	    <me>
	      0 , \frac{1}{d} 2 \pi ,
	      \frac{2}{d} 2 \pi ,
	      \ldots,
	      \frac{d-1}{d} 2 \pi .
	    </me>
	    In other words, the <m>d</m> roots are
	    <me>
	      1, e^{i2\pi/d},
	      e^{i4\pi/d},
	      \ldots,
	      e^{i2(d-1)\pi/d} .
	    </me>
	    These are called the <m>d</m>th <idx>roots of unity</idx><term>roots of unity</term>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    For example, if <m>d=3</m>, the third roots of unity, that is

	    <me>
	      1, e^{i2\pi/3}, e^{i4\pi/3} .

	    <m>P(x,y) = c_{00} + c_{10} x + c_{01} y + c_{20} x^2 +
	      c_{11} xy + \cdots</m>

	    <m>\bar{z}</m>.  If all the parenthesis are expanded <m>P</m>
	    contains no <m>\bar{z}</m>, then <m>P</m> is analytic.
	    If there are <m>\bar{z}</m>'s left, then <m>P</m> is not analytic.
	  </p>
	</lemma>

	<example>
	  <p>
	    Let's start with
	    <me>
	      \begin{split}
	      x^2-y^2+2ixy  &amp; = 
	      {\left( \frac{z+\bar{z}}{2} \right)}^2 -
	      {\left( \frac{z-\bar{z}}{2i} \right)}^2 +
	      2i {\left( \frac{z+\bar{z}}{2} \right)}
	      {\left( \frac{z-\bar{z}}{2i} \right)}
	      \\
	      &amp; =
	      \cdots = z^2 .
	      \end{split}
	    </me>
	    No <m>\bar{z}</m> anywhere in sight,
	    so this polynomial is analytic.
	  </p>
	</example>

	<example>
	  <p>
	    On the other hand
	    <me>
	      x^2+y^2 = 
	      {\left( \frac{z+\bar{z}}{2} \right)}^2 +
	      {\left( \frac{z-\bar{z}}{2i} \right)}^2 =
	      \cdots = z \bar{z} .
	    </me>
	    So this polynomial is not analytic.

	<title>Cauchy-Riemann Equations</title>

	<p>
	  Let <m>u_x, u_y, v_x, v_y</m> be the real partial derivatives
	  in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  E.g.
	  <me>
	    u_x(x,y) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{u(x+\delta,y)-u(x,y)}{\delta} .
	  </me>
	  where the limit is the real limit, that is <m>\delta</m> is real,
	  not complex.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Suppose the complex derivative of <m>f = u+iv</m> exists at
	  <m>z=x+iy</m>.  When we take the limit as a complex
	  <m>\Delta \to 0</m>, we might as well let it approach
	  along the real axis.  That is, we let <m>\Delta = \delta</m>,
	  for a real <m>\delta</m>:
	  <me>
	    \begin{split}
	    \Re f'(z) &amp; =  \Re \lim_{\Delta \to 0} \frac{f(z+\Delta)-f(z)}{\Delta}
	    \\
	    &amp; =
	    \Re \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{f(z+\delta)-f(z)}{\delta}
	    \\
	    &amp; =
	    \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{u(x+\delta,y)-u(x,y)}{\delta}
	    = u_x(x,y) .
	    \end{split}
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Next instead of letting <m>\Delta</m> be <m>\delta</m>, we let
	  <m>\Delta = i \delta</m> for a real <m>\delta</m>.
	  After all since we're allowed to approach zero in any old way,
	  we might as well approach along the imaginary axis now.
	  <me>
	    \begin{split}
	    \Re f'(z) &amp; =  \Re \lim_{\Delta \to 0} \frac{f(z+\Delta)-f(z)}{\Delta}
	    \\
	    &amp; =
	    \Re
	    \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{u(x,y+\delta)+iv(x,y+\delta)-u(x,y)-iv(x,y)}{i\delta}
	    \\
	    &amp; =
	    \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{v(x,y+\delta)-v(x,y)}{\delta}
	    =
	    v_y(x,y) .
	    \end{split}
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Similarly
	  <me>
	    \begin{split}
	    \Im f'(z) &amp; =  \Im \lim_{\Delta \to 0} \frac{f(z+\Delta)-f(z)}{\Delta}
	    \\
	    &amp;
	    =
	    \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{v(x+\delta,y)-v(x,y)}{\delta}
	    =
	    \lim_{\delta \to 0} -\frac{u(x,y+\delta)-u(x,y)}{\delta}
	    \\
	    &amp; =
	    v_x (x,y) = -u_y (x,y) .
	    \end{split}
	  </me>
	  So if the complex derivatie exists we find
	  <me>
	    f'(z) = u_x (x,y) + iv_x (x,y) \quad \text{and} \quad
	    f'(z) = v_y (x,y) - iu_y (x,y) .
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p>
	  If <m>f</m> complex differentiable, then the two expressions
	  for the complex derivative <m>f'(z)</m> must of course be
	  equal, or in other words:
	  <me>
	    u_x = v_y, \qquad
	    v_x = -u_y .
	  </me>
	  These equations are called the
	  <idx>Cauchy-Riemann equations</idx>
	  <idx>CR equations</idx>
	  <term>Cauchy-Riemann</term> (CR) equations.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If we apply the above calculation at every point we find one
	  direction of the following theorem.
	</p>

	<theorem>
	  <p>
	    A function <m>f</m> defined on a domain <m>U</m> is analytic
	    if and only if the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for all points in
	    <m>U</m>.
	  </p>
	</theorem>

	<p>
	  It is generally much easier to check that a function is analytic 
	  by checking the
	  Cauchy-Riemman equations rather than by computing the limit.

	<example>
	  <p>
	    Expand around a point <m>f(0)+az + b\bar{z} + ...</m>.  So
	    CR imply no <m>\bar{z}</m>

	  Exponential <m>e^z</m>.  Properties
	  <me>
	    e^z \not= 0, e^0=1, \frac{d}{dz} e^z = e^z, e^{z+w} = e^ze^w,
	    \overline{e^z} = e^{\bar{z}}, e^z=e^{z+2\pi ki}, \abs{e^z} = e^{\Re
	    z}, \arg e^z = \Im z
	  </me>
	  Let's show the derivative.
	  We know it's complex differentiable we might as well just
	  differentiate in <m>x</m>.  So
	  <me>
	    \frac{d}{dz} e^z
	    =
	    \frac{d}{dx} e^x (\cos y + i \sin y)
	    =

	  Infinitely many to one.  Always infinitely many roots of <m>e^z =

	  solution <m>z=0</m>, but also <m>z=2\pi ki</m> for any integer
	  <m>k</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Logarithm is the <q>inverse</q> of the exponential.  Of course as
	  the exponential is infinitely many to one, the logarithm is not a
	  well defined function.  It is an infinitely many valued function.
	  That is we wish to say that if <m>e^z = w</m>, then
	  <me>
	    \log w = z
	  </me>
	  but we also get that
	  <me>
	    \log w = z + 2\pi k i
	  </me>
	  for any integer <m>k</m>. other properties that follow is that
	  <m>\log 0</m> is undefined.  and the corresponding properties from
	  the exponential
	  <me>
	    \log 1 = 2 \pi i k, \log z + \log w = \log zw,
	    \log z = \log z + 2\pi ki
	  </me>
	  Since
	  <me>
	    z = e^{\log z}, \qquad \text{then} \qquad
	    1 = \frac{d}{dz}  e^{\log z} =
	    \left( \frac{d}{dz} \log z \right) e^{\log z}
	    \left( \frac{d}{dz} \log z \right) z
	  </me>
	  so
	  <me>
	    \frac{d}{dz} \log z = \frac{1}{z}
	  </me>
	  as expected.
	</p>

	<p>
	  No matter, how do we compute it?
	  We have
	  <me>
	    e^z = w = \abs{w}e^{i\arg w}
	  </me>
	  Taking logs we get
	  <me>
	    \log w = \log \abs{w}e^{i\arg w}
	    = (\log \abs{w}) + \log e^{i\arg w}
	    = (\log \abs{w}) + i\arg w
	  </me>
	  So the multivaluedness of <m>\log</m> is just like the
	  multivaluedness of the argument.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Just as we have the principal branch of arg, called Arg, that is
	  valued in <m>-\pi \lt \Arg z \leq \pi</m> we have the principal
	  branch  of the log, called Log defined by
	  <me>
	    \Log z = \log \abs{z} + i \Arg z
	  </me>
	  This is usually what the computers will compute if you plug a
	  complex number into log.  It is a single valued function, but it is
	  not continuous along the negative reals.  DRAW, explain.
	  Now a different branch could have been picked for the argument,
	  such as taking the argument in the range <m>[0,2\pi)</m> which
	  would be another fine choice and then the logarithm you get is not
	  continuous on the positive reals.  Any choice you make will be
	  discontonious somewhere if you want a function.  We will see that
	  this is not a defect, this is really what makes complex analysis so
	  useful.  One says that log is an analytic multivalued function
	  defined on the punctured plane.  But if we want an actual analytic
	  function, we must make a <q>cut</q>...
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally let's define trig functions.  We have that
	  <me>
	    e^{it} = \cos t + i \sin t
	    \qquad
	    e^{-it} = \cos t - i \sin t
	  </me>
	  We could say: let this also hold for complex <m>t</m>.  And then we
	  have
	  <me>
	    \cos z = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}
	    \qquad
	    \sin z = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}
	  </me>
	  And these are the definitions of comlex sine and cosine.  When
	  <m>z</m> is real, these are the standard sin and cosine for real
	  numbers.
	  <me>
	    \cos (-z) = \cos z, \sin(-z) = - \sin z, 
	  </me>
	  <me>
	    0 = \cos z, \qquad \text{for} z = k \pi
	  </me>
	  <me>
	    0 = \sin z, \qquad \text{for} z = k \pi + \pi/2
	  </me>
	  <me>
	    (\cos z)^2 + (\sin z)^2 = 1
	  </me>
	  Actually all the standard identities hold.  The moment we have an
	  identity for all real numbers it turns out it holds for all complex
	  numbers too.
	</p>

	<p>
	  FIXME:Check differentiation rules for sine and cosine
	</p>

	<p>
	  Similarly we define so called hyperbolic trig functions
	  <me>
	    \cosh z = \frac{e^{z} + e^{-z}}{2}
	    \qquad
	    \sinh z = \frac{e^{z} - e^{-z}}{2}
	  </me>

	<p>
	  Maximum principle: If <m>u</m> is harmonic on a domain (connected

	  <m>u</m> is constant.
	  That is, harmonic functions are all saddle surfaces at best.
	</p>

	<theorem>
	  <p>
	    The real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are
	    harmonic.
	  </p>
	</theorem>

	<p>
	  To see the theorem, we take the Cauchy Riemann equations
	  <me>
	    u_x = v_y, \qquad
	    u_y = - v_x ,
	  </me>
	  and we differentiate them.  The first equation we differentiate

	  <me>
	    u_{xx} = v_{xy}, \qquad
	    u_{yy} = - v_{xy} .
	  </me>
	  So
	  <me>
	    u_{xx} + u_{yy} = v_{xy} - v_{xy} = 0 .

	  Similarly
	  <me>
	    v_{xx} + v_{yy} = 0
	  </me>

	<p>
	  FIXME: Define <idx>harmonic conjugate</idx><term>harmonic conjugate</term> of <m>u</m>.
	</p>

	<example>
	  <p>
	    Example: <m>u = x^2-y^2</m> is harmonic.
	    Then as <m>u_x = v_y</m>, then
	    <me>
	      2x = v_y

	    Example: <m>\log \abs{z}</m> is harmonic, but no harmonic conjugate

	    v(x,y) = \int_{y_0}^y u_x(x,t)\, dt + C(x)

	  We have not only figured out how to construct the complex conjugate
